Monuments are such testaments that speak volumes of bloodshed and sacrifices, rise and downfall of empires, advancement in generation and culture. They are the epitomes of modes of thoughts involved in the ancient era. Monuments in Delhi are one of those epic and unique history bearers that fascinate its sightseer unveiling humongous amounts of glory hidden within. Here is the list of megaliths for you to travel around.\n</p>\n\n<h2 class="section-heading">India Gate</h2>\n<div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10 col-lg-10" src="img/india2.jpg" alt="">\n                    </div>\n                    \n               \n\n<p>\nIndia Gate, the pride and embodiment of India, is built as a tribute to the martyrs to reminisce their valour and sacrifice in serving their country during the First World War. It is also called as "All India War Memorial" located astride Rajpath and its view is as that of an arch standing erect in all its glory. All along its stature, the gate bears the beautifully carved names of 82,000 soldiers who sacrificed their lives and the place whispers the aura of their gallantry. The tricolours of the Indian flag under the velvety sky illuminate the India Gate every evening and the sight alone makes it adorn the top position in the list of tourist sites in Delhi.\n</p>\n\n<h2 class="section-heading">Red Fort</h2>\n                    <div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10  col-lg-10 " src="img/red.jpg" alt="">\n                    </div>\n                    \n                   \n<p>\nRed Fort is well known for its massive enclosing walls of red sandstone. Its architecture bellows the supremacy and royalty of Indo-Islamic and Mughal epoch. It nearly served for about 200 years as a main residence for the emperor of the Mughal dynasty and as the ceremonial and political centre of the Mughal state. The enormous building reflects a fusion of Timurid and Persian traditions. The Red Fort is the largest monument in Delhi and its importance is such that the Prime Minister of India hoists the tricoloured flag at the foremost entry of the fort. A sound and light show describing Mughal history is a tourist attraction in twilight and attracts thousands of individuals every year with its innovative architectural style.\n</p>\n\n<h2 class="section-heading">Qutub Minar</h2>\n  <div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10  col-lg-10 " src="img/qutub.jpg" alt="">\n                    </div>\n                    \n                  \n<p>\nAdorning the top position as the world''s highest minaret, Qutub Minar throngs with tourists and visitors every day. This slender tower of 240ft height, built by Qutub al-Din Aibak, the founder of the Delhi Sultanate, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Behold the magnificence of one of the earliest monuments whose flanges are dark Redstone throughout the tallness and are engraved with versus from Quran in Arabic and Nagari. The Mosque is located at the foot of Qutub Minar that is a part of Qutub Complex, comprising of an iron pillar that is more than 2000 years old but still has not rusted. Interesting, is it not? \n</P>\n\n<h2 class="section-heading">Jantar Mantar</h2>\n  <div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10  col-lg-10 " src="img/jantar.jpg" alt="">\n                    </div>\n                    \n                   <p>\nAt this megalith situated in Delhi, you will step into the world of a fine arts used as  calculation instruments in early era, dating nearly 200 years back. It is one of the five observatories constructed by Maharajah Sawaii Jai Singh II of Jaipur to serve the purpose of astronomical measurements. You will be baffled to know that though these monuments have captivated the attention of architects, artists and historians worldwide for its uniqueness, Jantar Mantar is still unknown to the large part of people. Its unique edifices that are far from comprehension to the neutral minds are a sight to monitor. \nAs the conclusion goes, be curious for the old stories of these places that offer a sanctuary for you to lose yourselves in their clutches.\n</P>\n', 'Geeta Sowmya', 'historical.png', 'monumentrec.jpg'),

I felt like, this place is highly underrated & have so much to offer to the youth. The artworks silently discuss varied topics without uttering a single word. Some paintings involved engineering, some logic, and some involved imagination of the minds but all sure to offer your heart the peace you sought for long .With paintings of various infamous artists like Thomas Daniell, Antonio Trindade, Amrita Sher-Gil, B.C.

I had an experience once and trust me sitting at home with your own playlist was a much better option.\n</p>\n  \n<p>\nI''ll be honest, listening to ''Kun Faya Kun'' every single time is overwhelming.

With the scent of rose petals, vibrant chaddars, grilled kebabs, lit incense sticks, the whole atmosphere is divine. I found people from all walks of life there. No hindus,  muslims or Christians, just God''s children who came to become one with the almighty.\n</p>\n  \n\n\n<p>\nAnd then started the music.

So let me share some details about it. \n</p>\n<p>The Delhi one is one of the five Nehru Planetariums in India including Mumbai,\nPune, Bangalore &amp; the Jawahar Planetarium in Allahabad.

Yeah you heard it right, all 3D epic sky watching at just 50.Try it out on month ends, if you know what I mean. \n</p>\n          \n<p>\nThe hallway houses the space museum which reminded me of the thermocole sheets I used up making solar projects, all of which ended up in small pieces scattered throughout the classroom once the grading was done. \n</p>\n<p>\nSo the show started at 11.30 am  in the dome shaped sky theatre & the narrator took us through the journey of solar system on his Definiti optical star projector "Megastar" that can show 2 million stars.\n</p>\n<div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10  col-lg-10 " src="img/planet2.jpg" alt="">\n                    </div>\n                    \n                   \n\n<p>The hour long show taught me two things. First how big & vast our galaxy is, it really makes you wonder. Who knows there might be a real PK searching for his remote somewhere. Second never take a lousy friend along who will fall asleep on the extra cushy & comfy chairs with the soft background music and end up with his own musical snores.\n</p>\n<p>\nOther major attractions include the Soyuz T-10 which carried India''s first cosmonaut Rakesh Sharma to space, along with his space suit and mission journal.

One of us was comfortable as she did it before, two had never done skating. I ,on the other hand, used to skate as a child, so was totally confused & excited at the same time. Our slot started, we went in.

Cautious of not to have that same grin I went to my friends, caught hold of them & started skating in the middle, one slide at a time. And after two rounds out of nowhere we lost our balance & bam, our bums first kiss with the icy floor. It was chilling.

They''re easy to add layers over as well as hide layers under, making them the perfect transitional pieces of clothing.</p>\n<p>So recently when I picked up this black Maxi dress from ZARA, I realised that I could actually wear it to a lot of occasions. From dressed up fancy to boho chic, work appropriate to a playful weekend ensemble, this basic outfit could be styled in numerous ways and thus, I decided to create these 4 looks and share them with you all.</p>\n<h2 class="section-heading">1) The College Look</h2>\n<br>\n<p>This casual ensemble is definitely my favourite. Whether you are going to college or simply hanging out with friends, this outfit can never let you down.</p>\n<p>Just throw a denim/bomber jacket over your maxi dress and complete the look with a cute bag and accessories. You can even knot the bottom of your dress for a street-chic appeal.</p>\n\n<div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10  col-lg-10 " src="img/maxi1.jpg" alt="">\n                    </div>\n                    \n<div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10  col-lg-10 " src="img/maxi2.jpg" alt="">\n                    </div>\n                    \n                   \n<div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10  col-lg-10 " src="img/maxi3.jpg" alt="">\n                    </div>\n                    \n                     \n\n \n  \n<div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10  col-lg-10 " src="img/maxi4.jpg" alt="">\n                    </div>\n                    \n                    <span class="caption text-muted">(Outfit- Maxi dress & Denim jacket: Zara, Shoes: H&M, Sunglasses: Rayban, Bag: River Island)\n</span>\n  \n\n<h2 class="section-heading">2) Holiday Look</h2>\n \n<p>A maxi dress is the perfect choice when we talk of holidays and beach destinations.

Even denims look great when worn with dresses.</li>\n<li>When it comes to dress size, make sure its neither too long or short. A knee to midi length hem is perfect.

Our day begins with a sip of tea and it is a good reason to possess a relaxed, refreshed and an activated mind. One can only wish for late nights, good books, warm tea & nice dreams. If these things are in our possession there is no need for any other serene feeling in this world. The tender aroma hitting one''s nostrils on a rainy day makes us disappear into a world of quiet contemplation of life. Such is the part tea holds in our life. Below are some of the popular varieties once should try in their lifetime.</p>\n<h2 class="section-heading">\n\n\n\n1.	Black Tea or Red Tea </h2>\n\n\n\n<div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10  col-lg-10 " src="img/tea1.png" alt="">\n                    </div>\n                   \n                    \n\n<p>\nWhen strongly blended tea leaves are added to boiling water, a reddish mixture is formed which is meant to be filtered.

Generally, 3 grams of tea per 200 ml of water, or about two teaspoons of oolong tea per cup, should be used. The water should not be exactly boiling, 93 to 96 &#176;C water is enough and steeped 3-10 minutes.

Steeping is done for a longer time to extract its flavour but if overdone, there is a chance you might kill the taste. Some call it miracle weight loss tea.

Like how on earth will I find pork chops, ground beef, artichokes, greek yogurt, tuna etc on my baju wala baniya. Never having consulted a professional nutritionist I would''ve continued blaming non-availability of things for my not so internationally perfect eating habits if it wasn''t for a video, that admittedly, I only watched because I thought that Alia Bhatt was wearing a really cute top. </p>\n<div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10  col-lg-10 " src="img/eat1.jpg" alt="">\n                    </div>\n<p>Recently, while watching a Facebook live session hosted by celebrity nutritionist and author, <i>Rujuta Diwekar</i> and Bollywood''s best, <i>Alia Bhatt</i>, it all became a little clearer to me. Rujuta Diwekar, emphasized on the concept of eating "locally", which she says is the right way to eat healthy. Let me elucidate the concept of "eating locally" using a few examples.</p>\n\n<div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10  col-lg-10 " src="img/eat2.jpg" alt="">\n                    </div>\n                    \n\n<p>Some fats are essential to our diets; we often refer to them as the healthy fats, the fats we usually cook our food with.

But Mustard Oil in north India while Coconut Oil in South works just fine, as they are available easily in the respective areas. </p>\n\n\n  <div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10  col-lg-10 " src="img/eat3.jpg" alt="">\n                    </div>\n                                      \n                     \n	\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Let see another example. If a North Indian is asked to include Proteins in his or her diet how must he/she do it? ''Oh! the site says avocado'' & the search begins. Wake up please! Avocados aren''t grown locally in Northern parts of India, they will be scarcely available, mostly very expensive, often under application of chemicals for preservation. So just have your way with the variety of pulses, growing abundantly in Northern India, that are equally laden with protein. </p>\n\n\n                     \n	\n\n\n<div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10  col-lg-10 " src="img/eat4.jpg" alt="">\n                    </div>\n                    \n\n\n<p>Eating locally in turn gives a boost to the local farming & agriculture industry. The social benefits of this are borne by the famers and monetary benefits boost the overall economic growth of India. And we all know how it works, economic growth of the country will bring welfare to the people. </p>\n\n<div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10  col-lg-10 " src="img/eat5.jpg" alt="">\n                    </div>\n                    \n                     \n	\n\n\n\n<p>Other than this, eating locally grown items will reduce the consumption of packaged goods, an industry that today is a leading cause of pollution & also gives an invitation to natural disasters. </p>\n\n\n<div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10  col-lg-10 " src="img/eat6.jpg" alt="">\n                    </div>\n                    \n                     \n	\n\n\n\n<p>Isn''t it wonderful!

The coolest thing was taking a bath under the waterfalls and the warm fluid cascading along the surface of our body made the experience tantalizing. There was a road that stretched like a camel''s lump and hence named Camel''s back road. Morning walk on this road during the chilly weather was one of the best experiences I had. Trekking activities were just power packed and the destinations one reaches after the achievement like Cloud''s End, were mesmerizing. Mussoorie is truly a Queen of Hill Stations.

Jungle Safari was one of the best rides in the wild. To observe wild animals in their natural habitat in the Himalayas was exhilarating. Moreover, the view of Majestic Himalayas and the Shivalik Ranges was beautiful from a small hilltop known as Tiffin top. I should say I thoroughly enjoyed the tranquil atmosphere of the Bhullaka Lake and it was a surprise to me that this lake was maintained by the Indian Army.

You do not have to visit Africa to experience it, Sariska National Park provides you just that. The safari was arranged by the Sariska personnel. Luckily, I caught a glimpse of the tiger while undergoing the ride. It was the first time I saw a tiger in the open and was a little nervous but I guess this is the best way to see them, in their natural habitat. This place also has many multi-cuisine restaurants to satiate your hunger before going for sightseeing.</p>\n<h2 class="section-heading">Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary:</h2>\n<div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10  col-lg-10 " src="img/hill5.jpg" alt="">\n                    </div>\n<p>You can find the rarest endangered species and more than 230 varied species of birds perched on trees or flying around. I was so captured by their beauty that I did not miss this opportunity to capture them in my camera. I would say it''s a bird watcher''s paradise. You can find solitude in these areas and can just ease all your worries in the comfort provided by Mother Nature. You do not have to burn a hole in your pocket to visit this place; all you need is a camera. </p>\n<p>Weekends do not count unless you spend them wholeheartedly by pushing all your worries aside.
